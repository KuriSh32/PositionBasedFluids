## Introduction
Real-time fluid simulation based on 3D position, implemented with reference to the paper "Position based fluids" by Miles Macklin and Matthias MÃ¼ller.

Real-time screen-space fluid rendering, implemented with reference to the paper "Screen space fluid rendering with curvature flow" by W. J. van der Laan, S. Green, and M. Sainz.

## Features
Simulation powered by OpenGL Compute Shaders

Fluid rendering using point sprites (screen oriented quads)

ImGui-based user interface for performance monitoring, parameter tuning, and real-time interaction
